prompt built rock, paper, scissors

## Task
Create the game Rock Paper Scissors game against the computer in the browser using alerts and prompts.

## Requirements
* Get the player input through the browser
* Create a random move for the computer
* You should play the best of five rounds between the player and the computer
* You will need to check for a winner after each round
* You should display the score after each round

### Implementation
I put the entire project within a While do loop with a simple boolean exit condition to allow the user to play again if they wish. The main body is built within a switch statement with a set of `if else` statements to model the results of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

### Rules
* best of five rounds
* rock beats scissors
* scissors beat paper
* paper beats rock
incorrect input will give the the CPU a point.
